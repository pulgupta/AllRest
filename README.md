# AllRest

In this project I will try to highlight different ways of creating Rest services.
This project will first cover the Spring way of developing rest services which I believe is the sleekest way do doing the same. 
After this is done we can see how to do some thing similar using the spring boot annotations.

Once spring is fully explored we will move to JAS RX way to create Rest service.

My favorite way of as of now is spring which abstracts lot of things but still giving you enough control and thus I consider it better than spring boot.

##Code Layout

Each technology is used in a separate package. Example Spring demos are placed in a package with spring key. Similarly JAX-RS has a separate package.
